collision_geometry.py

PROBLOG EXTERNAL-PREDICATE MODULE -- imported directly by ProbLog's own
:- use_module('./collision_geometry.py'). directive inside
basic_action_theory.pl, same mechanism as planners.py's own
:- use_module(...) directive (see that file's header for the mechanics).
Lives NEXT TO basic_action_theory.pl in module/theory/, not in
module/contracts/ -- this isn't a BT.cpp-facing node/condition, it's an
internal performance black box for the action theory's own
obstacle-clearance geometry.

WHY THIS EXISTS: basic_action_theory.pl used to compute
first_threshold_crossing_time/6 (the earliest time a noisy trajectory
comes within a given distance of any obstacle -- the basis for the
`collision` trigger and, now, the generic `obstacle_in_bound(Threshold)`
trigger too) entirely in Prolog: a
60-sample bracket scan, each sample checking clearance against every
obstacle polygon's every edge, followed by a bisection refinement. None
of that computation is actually PROBABILISTIC once Z (the resolved
lateral-noise draw) is fixed -- it's a deterministic function of
(ControlPoints, T0, Duration, Z, Threshold, the obstacle set). But
ProbLog's grounding materializes a full proof-tree node for every one of
those bracket/bisection steps anyway, for every resolved Z, which is
what made collision detection scale so badly with obstacle count/
complexity (see basic_action_theory.pl's own note above dist/5). Moving it
here collapses that whole grounding subtree into ONE black-box call per
resolved world -- exactly the same "stateless computation, no frame
problem, so no reason to pay Reiter's machinery's cost" argument already
used to justify planWith/plan_call being a Python black box instead of
Prolog clauses.

CORRECTNESS: the algorithm below is a LINE-FOR-LINE port of
basic_action_theory.pl's former Prolog implementation (same bracket-scan
sample count, same bisection epsilon, same spline/noise formulas) --
not a re-derivation. bracket_samples, crossing_eps, and position_sigma
are read directly out of the problem's own config.yaml at import time
(the SAME file module/translators/config_to_prolog.py turns into
config_generated.pl for the Prolog side, see that module's own header)
rather than hardcoded a second time here, so config.yaml stays the
single source of truth for both the Prolog and Python halves of the
theory with no risk of the two drifting apart. Which problem's
config.yaml is read is controlled by BT_PROBLEM_DIR, same as
_OBSTACLES_PATH below (see this module's own _PROBLEM_DIR note).

Exposes SEVEN predicates to ProbLog, all INSTANTANEOUS and stateless,
exactly like planners.py's plan_astar/plan_straight:

    first_threshold_crossing_time(+ControlPoints,+T0,+Duration,+Z,+Zt,
                                   +Threshold, -Tcross, -ObstacleId)
    obstacle_within_threshold(+X,+Y,+Threshold)
    first_on_path_crossing_time(+ControlPoints,+T0,+Duration,+Z,+Zt,
                                 +Threshold, -Tcross, -ObstacleId)
    obstacle_on_path_within_threshold(+ControlPoints,+T0,+Duration,+Z,+Zt,
                                       +X,+Y,+Threshold)
    first_line_of_sight_clear_time(+ControlPoints,+T0,+Duration,+Z,+Zt,
                                    +ObstacleId,+GX,+GY, -Tcross)
    line_of_sight_clear(+X,+Y,+ObstacleId,+GX,+GY)
    first_segment_crossing_time(+ControlPoints,+T0,+Duration,+Z,+Zt,
                                 +SX,+SY,+GX,+GY, -Tcross)

The last three back the Bug-algorithm boundary-LEAVE triggers/condition
(line_of_sight_clear = Bug0's rule, crosses_segment/first_segment_
crossing_time = Bug2's rule) -- see the "BUG-ALGORITHM BOUNDARY-LEAVE
PRIMITIVES" section below for why these are TRIGGER-side machinery,
not a new planner: the planner (planners.py's follow_boarder)
just walks a full clockwise loop around an obstacle's offset boundary
unconditionally now; WHICH bug variant a MoveTo leg implements is a
matter of which of these two triggers its own Triggers list names,
exactly the same "one action, swappable Triggers list" shape collision/
battery/obstacle_in_bound/etc. already have -- not two separate planner
functions with the stopping rule baked in (an earlier version of this
file's own history did that; see git log for why it changed).

Z and Zt are the TWO independent, already-resolved per-walk noise
draws _walk_noisy_point combines (normal/lateral and tangential/
along-path respectively -- see that function's own header for the
formula and why Duration itself stays independent of both). Every
trajectory-searching predicate here needs both; obstacle_within_threshold
and line_of_sight_clear are the exceptions -- they only ever check a
single ALREADY-COMPUTED point, so they have no noise draws of their
own to take.

first_threshold_crossing_time is the TRIGGER-side primitive: searches a
whole future trajectory (bracket scan + bisection) for the earliest
crossing. obstacle_within_threshold is the CONDITION-side primitive:
checks ONE point (the current situation) directly, no search at all --
it's what backs basic_action_theory.pl's holds(obstacle_in_bound(...),S),
the exact same underlying test (within_obstacle_threshold/
_min_clearance_all) the trigger-side search calls repeatedly, called
here just once. This is the "reuse the underlying machinery" the
obstacle_in_bound(Threshold) trigger/condition pair was built around --
see basic_action_theory.pl's own TRIGGERS section note.

first_on_path_crossing_time / obstacle_on_path_within_threshold are the
SAME trigger/condition pair again, for obstacle_on_path(Threshold):
"is Threshold-close to an obstacle the trajectory ACTUALLY ENTERS
somewhere along this walk" rather than any obstacle at all. Built by
restricting the SAME two functions above to a FILTERED obstacle set
(see _path_obstacle_polygons) -- no new geometry, just a different
input list.

ObstacleId is the SAME atom as the crossed obstacle's obstacle_polygon/2
Id (e.g. obs7) -- whichever polygon achieves the minimum clearance at
the exact (bisected) crossing point, i.e. an argmin over obstacles, not
just the min distance. This is what lets basic_action_theory.pl's
trigger_crossing_time/9 report crashed(ObstacleId)/
obstacle_in_bound(Threshold,ObstacleId) instead of a bare atom -- see
this module's own _min_clearance_all for where the argmin actually
happens.

first_threshold_crossing_time FAILS (returns 0 ProbLog solutions) if
the trajectory never comes within Threshold of an obstacle in this
resolved world; obstacle_within_threshold FAILS if the current point
isn't within Threshold right now -- "never/not happening" is
represented by absence in both, not a sentinel value, same convention
as every other exact-detection predicate in this theory.

Obstacle polygons: loaded ONCE, at import time, directly from
<problem>/obstacles_generated.pl (see _PROBLEM_DIR above) -- the EXACT
SAME file basic_action_theory.pl's own problem_data.pl bootstrap
consults (see Section 0's own comment, near the top of that file). By
the time this module is imported, that consult has already either
succeeded or already aborted the whole load with a clearer error, so
there is no meaningful "obstacles file missing" case to handle
gracefully here (unlike planners.py's map, which is genuinely
optional). If you hand-add extra obstacle_polygon/2 facts somewhere
else in the theory instead of through occgrid_to_problog.py's generated
file, this black box will not see them -- keep obstacles_generated.pl
the single source of truth, exactly as planners.py's own map
loading already assumes for map.yaml.

Everything below the constant/obstacle loading is PLAIN PYTHON, with no
ProbLog types anywhere -- first_threshold_crossing_time_value is the
testable core; the ProbLog import itself is wrapped in a try/except
(_HAVE_PROBLOG), same pattern as planners.py, purely so
this module can be exercised directly (e.g. to numerically compare
against the old Prolog implementation) without needing a full ProbLog
run.
