planners.py

Lives in module/theory/ alongside basic_action_theory.pl and
collision_geometry.py -- see this project's top-level layout note
(basic_action_theory.pl's own header comment) for why these are grouped
together. module/contracts/bt_actions.py (the BT.cpp-facing side of the
same node set) imports the plain-Python API below from here.

TWO independent roles, kept in ONE file because they share the exact
same underlying A*/spline computation and neither should reimplement it:

  1. PROBLOG EXTERNAL-PREDICATE MODULE -- imported by ProbLog's own
     :- use_module('./planners.py'). directive inside
     basic_action_theory.pl (see problog.clausedb.ClauseDB.load_external_
     module, which execs this file as a plain Python module the moment
     that directive is loaded, triggering the
     @problog_export_nondet(...)-decorated functions below to register
     themselves as callable ProbLog predicates:
         plan_astar(+SX,+SY,+GX,+GY, -ControlPoints)
         plan_straight(+SX,+SY,+GX,+GY, -ControlPoints)
         plan_voronoi(+SX,+SY,+GX,+GY, -ControlPoints)
         follow_boarder(+SX,+SY,+ObstacleId,+Offset, -ControlPoints)
     ControlPoints = [point(X0,Y0), ...] ProbLog terms, length 3k+1, in
     EXACTLY the format basic_action_theory.pl's spline_point/4 expects.
     plan_voronoi is a generalized-Voronoi-diagram planner, SAME
     interface as plan_astar/plan_straight -- see
     _voronoi_control_points' own header for the full geometry.
     follow_boarder is a boundary-following planner shared by every
     Bug-algorithm variant: it just plans a full clockwise loop around
     an obstacle's offset boundary and does NOT decide when to leave it
     -- that decision belongs to whichever TRIGGER halts the subsequent
     moveto_leg walking this planner's own output (see collision_
     geometry.py's "BUG-ALGORITHM BOUNDARY-LEAVE PRIMITIVES" section).
     There is deliberately no Goal parameter here -- see
     _follow_boarder_control_points's own header.

  2. PLAIN-PYTHON API for a BT.cpp / bt_actions.py caller that has
     nothing to do with ProbLog -- plan_astar_points/plan_straight_points/
     plan_voronoi_points/follow_boarder_points below, returning plain
     (x,y) float tuples, no ProbLog Term objects and no ProbLog import
     required to call them. The `import problog` needed for role 1 is
     wrapped in a try/except (_HAVE_PROBLOG) so that importing this
     module from a pure BT.cpp bridge that never installs ProbLog still
     works -- only the ProbLog predicates themselves become unavailable
     in that case, exactly mirroring how plan_astar already degrades
     gracefully (fails rather than crashing) when the map itself fails
     to load.

Each role funnels through the SAME plain-Python core per planner
(_astar_control_points / _straight_control_points /
_voronoi_control_points / _follow_boarder_control_points) -- no
duplicated logic between the ProbLog-facing and BT.cpp-facing entry
points for any of the four.

FAILURE: if A* finds no path (start/goal unreachable, or the map failed
to load at import time), the core returns None -- the ProbLog predicate
then returns zero solutions (i.e. the predicate call FAILS, exactly like
any other "this doesn't happen" case elsewhere in this theory, e.g.
first_collision_time), and the plain-Python function returns None for
its own BT.cpp caller to check. plan_straight/plan_straight_points only
fail on degenerate (non-finite) input; a straight line between two
ordinary points always exists.

Map location: loaded ONCE, at import time (i.e. once per process), from
<problem>/map.yaml, where <problem> is problems/problem0/ by default or
whichever directory the BT_PROBLEM_DIR environment variable names --
main.py sets BT_PROBLEM_DIR before ProbLog loads this module, so a run
against a different --problem picks up that problem's own map without
this file ever changing. See MAP_YAML_PATH below. If the map can't be
loaded, both the ProbLog predicate and the plain-Python function still
work, but astar-based planning will always fail (no map to plan
against) rather than crashing at import time.

MAP/A*/SPLINE LIBRARY CODE below (OccupancyGridMap, load_map_yaml,
inflate_obstacles, astar, fit_spline, bspline_to_bezier_chain) used to
live in a separate standalone interactive click-planner tool
(occupancy_grid_planner.py, now removed -- its own GUI/CLI were never
part of the live pipeline, only these library functions were still in
use, imported from here); merged directly into this file since this
module is now their only caller.
