pipeline_stages.py

Shared ProbLog pipeline plumbing used by both main.py and
diagnose_pipeline.py: a STAGED, LOGGED, PER-PHASE-TIMEOUT-BOUNDED
replacement for the single opaque
    get_evaluatable().create_from(model).evaluate()
call every earlier version of main.py used, plus the small
problem_data.pl bootstrap-writer both scripts need (factored out here
so the two callers can't drift out of sync on that file's shape).

Why staged: ProbLog's own pipeline internally does four genuinely
separate things --
  1. PARSE   the .pl source (following its own :- consult(...) chain)
             into a LogicProgram.
  2. GROUND  it -- SLD-resolution proof search over every query,
             which is exactly where do_node's forward walk over
             plan(Node) happens, interleaved with each fluent's
             Reiter-style regression back to s0 (at/4, battery/3,
             ... recursing inward through do(A,S) to the s0 base
             clause, then computing back outward). This is "the plan
             unrolled, regressed to the initial situation" in one
             step -- ProbLog doesn't expose those as two separate
             calls, because regression IS how grounding resolves each
             fluent along the way. Produces a ground LogicFormula:
             one Boolean variable per resolved random choice (z/2,
             zt/2, zbatt/1, ...), one node per combination of proofs
             found.
  3. COMPILE that Boolean formula into a tractable circuit (SDD by
             default) for EXACT weighted model counting.
  4. EVALUATE that circuit against the annotated-disjunction weights
             -- the ones that ultimately bottom out at s0's own facts
             -- to produce each query's final probability. This is
             "verification against the initial database" made
             concrete: the weights being summed over here are s0's.

Collapsing all four into one call gives zero information about which
one is actually stuck when a run hangs. This module makes each one an
explicit, timed, logged step -- confirmed useful directly: pointing
this same staged pipeline at problem3's real Bug0 tree showed the
stall is in stage 2 (grounding), not stage 3 (compilation) as the
project's own FUTUREWORK.md investigation -- done at the granularity
of "whole evaluate_plan query, timed end-to-end" -- had left open;
`problog ground` alone (no compilation at all) already failed to
finish within 90s at the committed 5-value noise tables, while it
finished in 1.7s once every noise table was collapsed to one
deterministic value.

Uses the SAME signal.alarm/SIGALRM + timeout-exception mechanism
ProbLog's own CLI --timeout/--compile-timeout flags use internally
(problog/util.py's start_timer/stop_timer, which raises
KeyboardInterrupt("Timeout") on the alarm) -- not a separate, weaker
mechanism of our own. Same caveat that mechanism carries: a
signal-based timeout can only be delivered at a Python bytecode
boundary. If a stage is blocked deep inside a C extension call
(pysdd's SDD compilation in particular) that never returns control to
the interpreter, the alarm fires but isn't actually delivered until
that call returns -- so a stage timeout here is a lower bound on
wall-clock time genuinely spent in that stage, not always a hard kill.
For a guaranteed hard kill, run diagnose_pipeline.py under the shell's
own `timeout` command (see that script's own header for the exact
invocation) -- that kills the whole OS process regardless of what it's
blocked inside.
